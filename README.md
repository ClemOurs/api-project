# Crossover between SWAPI and Sith Translator

as a big fan of star wars, I had to choose for this project two apis that were around the license that I love so much

## the links 
#
My APIs : 

[SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/documentation)

[Sith Translator](https://api.funtranslations.com/)

My Website :

## What you can do on the website
#

## with swapi
#
you can navigate between data about all the planets who can be seen in the 6 first episodes of the saga !
The 10 first planets are showed and you have a button to show to display ten additional planets.

if you click on one of this planet, you can acces to specific data about the planet and you have a button to return.
#
I have made mostly the same with the posters of the movies, if you click on one of those posters you'll have access to data about the movie.

I actually tried to get data about the vehicles, ships and people, but i had some difficulties (the code is still in my file.)

## Sith Translator 
#
you can translate english to the sith language with the second api i used !

# May the force be with you, always...
